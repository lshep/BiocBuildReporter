Title: Functions to process a bioconductor build report database
Version: 0.99.0
Description: This package reads remote parquet files that have processed Bioconductor build report logs. Users may query the tables directly for specific information or use pre-defined helper functions for common queries. The logs processed are from https://bioconductor.org/checkResults/. In the future we will extend this package out to include processing of r-universe logs.
